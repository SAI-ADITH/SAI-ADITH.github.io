## About Me

I’m **Sai Adith Senthil Kumar**, a dual-degree **Computer Science** student at **George Mason University** (B.S. ’26, M.S. ’27 — Machine Learning concentration).

My work focuses on **LLM interpretability and instruction-following**, with an emphasis on **activation-level methods** (e.g., sparse autoencoders), **persona simulation**, and **reasoning efficiency** (“thinking” vs. “no-thinking” behaviors under strict constraints).

In industry, I’ve built and deployed end-to-end AI systems — including **OCR + RAG pipelines** and **real-time insight generation** — with a focus on measurable improvements in **accuracy, latency, and reliability**.

## Research Interests

- Mechanistic interpretability (Sparse Autoencoders, feature analysis, activation steering)
- Instruction following (constraint satisfaction, persona simulation, counterfactual behavior)
- Efficiency & systems (reasoning budgets, lightweight steering/gating, deployment-aware evaluation)
- Trustworthy / safe LLMs (watermarking, monitoring signals, robustness testing)
- RAG systems (OCR → chunking → reranking → evaluation, hallucination reduction)

## News

- **[2025]** Our paper on **Counterfactual Instruction Following** was **accepted** at **Social Simulation @ COLM 2025**; the public version is available on arXiv.
- **[Aug. 2025]** Completed my AI Research & Engineering Summer Associate role at **AriesView** (OCR + RAG lease abstraction deployed on Azure).
- **[May. 2025]** Completed my AI Engineer internship at **Voicebotics AI**, building real-time call-insight pipelines.
- **[Aug. 2024]** Completed my ML Engineer internship at **Rise Consultancy EDU**, developing an AI-driven personalized learning-path generator.
